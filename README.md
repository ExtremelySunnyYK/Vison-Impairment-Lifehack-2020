## Diabetic Retinopathy 

Diabetic retinopathy (DR), also known as diabetic eye disease, is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus. It is a leading cause of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more. Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. **Retinal (fundus) photography with manual interpretation is a widely accepted screening tool for diabetic retinopathy**, with performance that can exceed that of in-person dilated eye examinations. 

The below figure shows an example of a healthy patient and a patient with diabetic retinopathy as viewed by fundus photography ([source](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/06/19/225508.full.pdf)):


An automated tool for grading severity of diabetic retinopathy would be very useful for accelerating detection and treatment. Recently, there have been a number of attempts to utilize deep learning to diagnose DR and automatically grade diabetic retinopathy. This includes a previous [competition](https://kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection) and [work by Google](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/11/deep-learning-for-detection-of-diabetic.html). Even one deep-learning based system is [FDA approved](https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm604357.htm). 

Clearly, this dataset and deep learning problem is quite important. 

## Meaning Of Prediction


>A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4, according to the following scale:
>
>0 - No DR
>
>1 - Mild
>
>2 - Moderate
>
>3 - Severe
>
>4 - Proliferative DR
>
>Your task is to create an automated analysis system capable of assigning a score based on this scale.
